# hello-world
First time on Github so obviously gotta do the hello world thing.

Just an average guy who is trying to get into doing some electronics - Worked as a programmer (C, C++, VB.NET, etc etc) for many years before getting utterly fed up with it and taking a break.

Recently started enjoying it again but I have also developed an interest in transistors and resistors and all that sort of stuff.

Github has been recommended by HackSpace friends as a useful tool so here I am.
